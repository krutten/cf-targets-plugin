CF Targets Plugin
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/norman-abramovitz/cf-targets-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/norman-abramovitz/cf-targets-plugin)

This plugin facilitates the use of multiple api targets with the Cloud Foundry CLI.

It originated from the need for a Go play project, and the realization that I was
frequently switching back and forth between development and various test environments,
using tricks like

```
CF_HOME=~/cf-development cf push my-app
CF_HOME=~/cf-production cf push my-app
```

This plugin makes switching a lot less painful by allowing you to save your currently
configured target using a name, then switching back to it by name at any point.


## Usage

Configure and save any number of named targets

```
$ cf api <development-target-url>
$ cf login
...
$ cf save-target development
```

Followed by

```
$ cf api <production-target-url>
$ cf login
...
$ cf save-target production
```

After saving targets, easily switch back and forth between them using:

```
$ cf set-target development
$ cf target
API Endpoint:   <development-target-url>
...
$ cf set-target production
$ cf target
API Endpoint:   <production-target-url>
...
```

View saved targets using

```
$ cf targets
development
production (current)
```
